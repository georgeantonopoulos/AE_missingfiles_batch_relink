# AE Helper Scripts! ✨

Hey there, After Effects adventurer! Got a couple of cool scripts here to make your life a bit easier.

## 1. `exportMissingFiles.jsx` - The Detective 🕵️‍♀️

**What's its deal?**
This script is your go-to when After Effects starts complaining about missing footage (we've all been there!). It scans your open project, finds all the files that have gone AWOL, and neatly lists their last known paths in a text file called `missingFiles.txt`. This list becomes the input for our next hero script.

**How to use it:**
1.  Open your After Effects project that has missing files.
2.  In AE, go to `File > Scripts > Run Script File...`
3.  Navigate to this `AE_Scripts` folder and select `exportMissingFiles.jsx`.
4.  Run it! It'll tell you what it's doing.
5.  Look for a `missingFiles.txt` file created in the same folder as the script itself (so, inside this `AE_Scripts` folder if you run it from here, or wherever AE considers the script's "home" when executed). *Ideally, `missingFiles.txt` is created next to your project file or in a predictable spot, but the original `exportMissingFiles.jsx` script logic places it next to the script itself.*

## 2. `BatchCollectAndRelink.jsx` - The Collector & Relinker 📦🔗

**What's its deal?**
This is the powerhouse script that takes your `missingFiles.txt` (generated by the Detective) and goes on a mission.
*   **Collects:** You'll tell it where to *search* for the missing files (like a big hard drive or project folder). It'll then hunt them down. If it finds files with the same name, it tries to be smart and pick the one whose original parent folder matches what's in your `missingFiles.txt`. All found files are copied into a new "collected footage" folder you choose, keeping a bit of the original folder structure.
*   **Relinks:** Once everything's gathered, it attempts to automatically relink the missing items in your After Effects project to these newly collected files.

It's a bit of a beast, but it keeps detailed logs of everything it does, so you can see what happened.

**How to use it:**
1.  **First, run `exportMissingFiles.jsx`** to get your `missingFiles.txt` if you haven't already. Make sure you know where `missingFiles.txt` was saved.
2.  In AE, go to `File > Scripts > Run Script File...`
3.  Navigate to this `AE_Scripts` folder and select `BatchCollectAndRelink.jsx`.
4.  Follow the prompts:
    *   It'll ask for your `missingFiles.txt`.
    *   Then, it'll ask for a **Search Directory** (where it should look for the actual source files).
    *   Finally, it'll ask for a **Destination Folder** (where it should copy the found files and save its logs).
5.  Let it do its magic! It can take a while if you're searching large areas.
6.  Check the log files (e.g., `_CollectionLog_SearchDupHandling.txt` and `_BatchCollectAndRelink_FullLog_SearchDupHandling.txt`) in your chosen Destination Folder to see the results.

**Important Notes:**
*   Always save your AE project before running scripts, just in case!
*   These scripts try their best, but complex projects or super messy file structures might still need some manual love. The logs are your guide!

Happy keyframing!
